  abstract    = {  These are lecture notes that arose from a representation theory course given
                 by the first author to the remaining six authors in March 2004 within the
                 framework of the Clay Mathematics Institute Research Academy for high school
                 students, and its extended version given by the first author to MIT
                 undergraduate math students in the Fall of 2008. The notes cover a number of
                 standard topics in representation theory of groups, Lie algebras, and quivers,
                 and contain many problems and exercises. They should be accessible to students
                 with a strong background in linear algebra and a basic knowledge of abstract
                 algebra, and may be used for an undergraduate or introductory graduate course
                 in representation theory.
